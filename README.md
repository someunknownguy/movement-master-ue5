# Movement Master (UE5)
This is my personal project, an attempt at bolstering my portefolio whilst learning both a new language (C++) and some game development.

The idea of Movement Master is to make a game where there are the player is in control of every aspect of their movement. Picture Counter Strike's bhop with less precision required, while hopefully adding more options.
