# Movement Master (UE5)
This is my personal project, an attempt at bolstering my portfolio whilst learning both a new language (C++) and some game development.

The idea of Movement Master is to make a game where there are the player is in control of nearly every aspect of their movement. Picture Counter Strike's bhop with less precision required, while hopefully adding more options.

As of 03/08/2023 what remained as blueprint project for my first attempts at controlling the movement using the default Character Controller Component is finally turning into a C++ project, as I realize that while blueprints are fun, they are not very productive.

I also believe that I will have to build my own solution of a Character Controller Component to allow the kind of interactions with the environment that I want.

Following the guide [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/setting-up-visual-studio-development-environment-for-cplusplus-projects-in-unreal-engine/) I set up visual studio 2022 to accomodate for all the dependencies required, and after a restart to resolve a certain "Live Coding" incident, all seems to work as expected.
